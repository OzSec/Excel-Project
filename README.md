# Excel Project

I used bike sales data for this excel project. Created pivot tables and charts, and finally demonstrated the key factors from data in an intuitive dashboard supported with couple slicer in order to filter the data visually.

There are 4 sheets:
1. Raw Data
2. Worksheet (In order to left the raw data untouched)
3. Pivot tables and graphs
4. Final Dashboard
